Candidates must have a strong analytical background and demonstrable interest in computational neuroscience. They should have completed (or be near to completing) a PhD or equivalent in neuroscience, cognitive science, computational neuroscience, computational cognitive science, physics, mathematics, computer science, machine learning or a related field. Preference will be given to candidates with sufficient programming skills to run numerical simulations (eg. in C or MatLab). Expertise with neural network models, analysis of dynamical systems, Bayesian techniques, or reinforcement learning, and familiarity with relevant neurobiology is an advantage.

Depending on their research interests applicants should apply directly to either [Guillaume Hennequin](https://ghennequin.github.io/) or [Máté Lengyel](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~m.lengyel) by e-mail and should include in PDF or plain text

*  their CV
*  a statement of research interests
*  names and full contact details (including e-mail addresses) of three referees

####   College Junior Research Fellowships for Postdoctoral  Fellows 

Many Cambridge colleges have Junior Research Fellowships (or similar) which can be either stipendiary (pay a salary + perks of a being fellow such as reduced cost of housing and free meals) or non-stipendiary (no salary - just the perks). All fellowships are advertised in the "College Notices" part of the Cambridge  Reporter which comes out weekly during term.  Each college tends to have its own eligibility rules and deadlines. The Reporter is available [online](http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/current/weekly/).
