Dendrites integrate inputs nonlinearly, but it is unclear how these
nonlinearities contribute to the overall input-output transformation of single
neurons. We developed statistically principled methods using a hierarchical
cascade of linear-nonlinear subunits (hLN) to model the dynamically evolving
somatic response of neurons receiving complex, in vivo-like spatiotemporal
synaptic input patterns. We used the hLN to predict the somatic membrane
potential of an in vivo-validated detailed biophysical model of a L2/3
pyramidal cell. Linear input integration with a single global dendritic
nonlinearity achieved above 90% prediction accuracy. A novel hLN motif, input
multiplexing into parallel processing channels, could improve predictions as
much as conventionally used additional layers of local nonlinearities. We
obtained similar results in two other cell types. This approach provides a
data-driven characterization of a key component of cortical circuit
computations: the input-output transformation of neurons during in vivo-like
conditions.
