<!-- Abstract here please. -->

Sensory cortices display a suite of ubiquitous dynamical features, such as
ongoing noise variability, transient overshoots and oscillations, that have so
far escaped a common, principled theoretical account. We developed a unifying
model for these phenomena by training a recurrent excitatory–inhibitory neural
circuit model of a visual cortical hypercolumn to perform sampling-based
probabilistic inference. The optimized network displayed several key biological
properties, including divisive normalization and stimulus-modulated noise
variability, inhibition-dominated transients at stimulus onset and strong gamma
oscillations. These dynamical features had distinct functional roles in
speeding up inferences and made predictions that we confirmed in novel analyses
of recordings from awake monkeys. Our results suggest that the basic motifs of
cortical dynamics emerge as a consequence of the efficient implementation of
the same computational function — fast sampling-based inference — and predict
further properties of these motifs that can be tested in future experiments.
