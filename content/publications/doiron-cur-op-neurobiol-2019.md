Computational neuroscience is coming of age. In the not-so-distant past, data
sets were small and painted a very incomplete picture of neuronal activity.
This forced theoreticians to build models that were limited in scope, and often
difficult to merge with theory being built from other small data sets.
Computational neuroscience was happening on isolated islands across our
community. We now live in an era where massive data sets are routinely
collected, which often cross many spatial and temporal scales and combine both
physiology and behaviour. Because of this, theoreticians now have the licence
(and necessity) to think more broadly, aiming for models that capture neural
activity over many scales, including behavior. In parallel, a more mature
theoretical community has built solid social networks (through conferences such
as the Computational Neuroscience, Computational and Systems Neuroscience, and
Cognitive Computational Neuroscience conferences) that encourage a vibrant
discussion across modelling traditions. All of this happens with an
ever-increasing understanding of the role of computation from experimentalists
(thanks, in large part, to summer courses co-training experimentalists with
theoreticians, such as the Woods Hole or CAJAL courses), significantly
enriching the discussion. This new world has not only deepened the
computational neuroscience happening on the islands but perhaps more
importantly has built bridges between them. This expansive theoretical
landscape that includes expertise across mathematical and statistical
communities is essential for any hope of using theory to help organize the data
coming from our much bigger windows into brain activity.

This issue of Current Opinion of Neurobiology is devoted to giving a flavor of
computational neuroscience being done in our time. To guide the reader we first
grouped the various reviews into ones that summarize work being done on an
island as well as ones describing the bridges that are being built between
islands. This grouping is by no means unique and is bound to reflect the tastes
of us as editors. All of the contributions have the spirit of a broad theory
that attempts to encompass rich and varied neuroscience questions. We hope that
these reviews inspire more bridges which will link even bigger islands.
