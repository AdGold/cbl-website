<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Two theoretical ideas have emerged recently with the ambition to provide a
unifying functional explanation of neural population coding and dynamics:
predictive coding and Bayesian inference. Here, we describe the two theories
and their combination into a single framework: Bayesian predictive coding. We
clarify how the two theories can be distinguished, despite sharing core
computational concepts and addressing an overlapping set of empirical
phenomena. We argue that predictive coding is an algorithmic/representational
motif that can serve several different computational goals of which Bayesian
inference is but one. Conversely, while Bayesian inference can utilize
predictive coding, it can also be realized by a variety of other
representations. We critically evaluate the experimental evidence supporting
Bayesian predictive coding and discuss how to test it more directly.
