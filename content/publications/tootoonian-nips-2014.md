<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

We study the early locust olfactory system in an attempt to explain its
well-characterized structure and dynamics. We first propose its computational
function as recovery of high-dimensional sparse olfactory signals from a small
number of measurements. Detailed experimental knowledge about this system rules
out standard algorithmic solutions to this problem. Instead, we show that
solving a dual formulation of the corresponding optimisation problem yields
structure and dynamics in good agreement with biological data. Further
biological constraints lead us to a reduced form of this dual formulation in
which the system uses independent component analysis to continuously adapt to
its olfactory environment to allow accurate sparse recovery. Our work
demonstrates the challenges and rewards of attempting detailed understanding of
experimentally well-characterized systems.
