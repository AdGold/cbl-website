<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

The dendritic tree contributes significantly to the elementary computations a
neuron performs while converting its synaptic inputs into action potential
output. Traditionally, these computations have been characterized as both
temporally and spatially localized. Under this account, neurons compute
near-instantaneous mappings from their current input to their current output,
brought about by somatic summation of dendritic contributions that are
generated in functionally segregated compartments. However, recent evidence
about the presence of oscillations in dendrites suggests a qualitatively
different mode of operation: the instantaneous phase of such oscillations can
depend on a long history of inputs, and, under appropriate conditions, even
dendritic oscillators that are remote may interact through synchronization.
Here, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the interactions of local
dendritic oscillations, and the way these interactions influ- ence single cell
computations. Combining weakly coupled oscillator methods with cable theoretic
arguments, we derive phase-locking states for multiple oscillating dendritic
compartments. We characterize how the phase-locking properties depend on key
parameters of the oscillating dendrite: the electrotonic properties of the
(active) dendritic segment, and the intrinsic properties of the dendritic
oscillators.  As a direct consequence, we show how input to the dendrites can
modulate phase-locking behavior and hence global dendritic coherence. In turn,
dendritic coherence is able to gate the integration and propagation of synaptic
signals to the soma, ultimately leading to an effective control of somatic
spike generation.  Our results suggest that dendritic oscillations enable the
dendritic tree to operate on more global temporal and spatial scales than
previously thought; notably that local dendritic activity may be a mechanism
for generating on-going whole-cell voltage oscillations.
