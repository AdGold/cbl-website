<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Cortical neurons integrate thousands of synaptic inputs in their dendrites in
highly nonlinear ways. It is unknown how these dendritic nonlinearities in
individual cells contribute to computations at the level of neural circuits.
Here, we show that dendritic nonlinearities are critical for the efficient
integration of synaptic inputs in circuits performing analog computations with
spiking neurons. We developed a theory that formalizes how a neuron's dendritic
nonlinearity that is optimal for integrating synaptic inputs depends on the
statistics of its presynaptic activity patterns. Based on their in vivo
preynaptic population statistics (firing rates, membrane potential
fluctuations, and correlations due to ensemble dynamics), our theory accurately
predicted the responses of two different types of cortical pyramidal cells to
patterned stimulation by two-photon glutamate uncaging. These results reveal a
new computational principle underlying dendritic integration in cortical
neurons by suggesting a functional link between cellular and systems--level
properties of cortical circuits.
