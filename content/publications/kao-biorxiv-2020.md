Across a range of motor and cognitive tasks, cortical activity can be
accurately described by low-dimensional dynamics unfolding from specific
initial conditions on every trial. These "preparatory states" largely
determine the subsequent evolution of both neural activity and behaviour, and
their importance raises questions regarding how they are − or ought to be −
set. Here, we formulate motor preparation as optimal prospective control of
future movements. The solution is a form of internal control of cortical
circuit dynamics, which can be implemented as a thalamo-cortical loop gated
by the basal ganglia. Critically, optimal control predicts selective
quenching of variability in components of preparatory population activity
that have future motor consequences, but not in others. This is consistent
with recent perturbation experiments performed in mice, and with our novel
analysis of monkey motor cortex activity during reaching. Together, these
results suggest optimal anticipatory control of movement.
