Across a range of motor and cognitive tasks, cortical activity can be
accurately described by low-dimensional dynamics unfolding from specific
initial conditions on every trial. These “preparatory states” largely
determine the subsequent evolution of both neural activity and behaviour, and
their importance raises questions regarding how they are ─ or ought to be ─
set. Here, we formulate motor preparation as optimal anticipatory control of
future movements, and show that the solution requires a form of internal
feedback control of cortical circuit dynamics. In contrast to a simple
feedforward strategy, feedback control enables fast movement preparation and
orthogonality between preparatory and movement activity, a distinctive
feature of peri-movement activity in reaching monkeys. We propose a circuit
model in which optimal preparatory control is implemented as a
thalamo-cortical loop gated by the basal ganglia.
