<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Even in state-spaces of modest size, planning is plagued by the “curse of
dimensionality”. This problem is particularly acute in human and animal
cognition given the limited capacity of working memory, and the time pressures
under which planning often occurs in the natural environment. Hierarchically
organized modular representations have long been suggested to underlie the
capacity of biological systems to efficiently and flexibly plan in complex
environments. However, the principles underlying efficient modularization
remain obscure, making it difficult to identify its behavioral and neural
signatures. Here, we develop a normative theory of efficient state-space
representations which partitions an environment into distinct modules by
minimizing the average (information theoretic) description length of planning
within the environment, thereby optimally trading off the complexity of
planning across and within modules. We show that such optimal representations
provide a unifying account for a diverse range of hitherto unrelated phenomena
at multiple levels of behavior and neural representation.
