<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

This is an invited commentary on [Ma et al., Nature Neuroscience (2006)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1790).

In 2006, [Ma et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1790) presented an
elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to
perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural
variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain
encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.
