<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

A venerable history of classical work on autoassociative memory has
significantly shaped our understanding of several features of the hippocampus,
and most prominently of its CA3 area, in relation to memory storage and
retrieval. However, existing theories of hippocampal memory processing ignore a
key biological constraint affecting memory storage in neural circuits: the
bounded dynamical range of synapses. Recent treatments based on the notion of
metaplasticity provide a powerful model for individual bounded synapses;
however, their implications for the ability of the hippocampus to retrieve
memories well and the dynamics of neurons associated with that retrieval are
both unknown. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for memory storage and
recall with bounded synapses. We formulate the recall of a previously stored
pattern from a noisy recall cue and limited-capacity (and therefore lossy)
synapses as a probabilistic inference problem, and derive neural dynamics that
implement approximate inference algorithms to solve this problem efficiently.
In particular, for binary synapses with metaplastic states, we demonstrate for
the first time that memories can be efficiently read out with biologically
plausible network dynamics that are completely constrained by the synaptic
plasticity rule, and the statistics of the stored patterns and of the recall
cue. Our theory organises into a coherent framework a wide range of existing
data about the regulation of excitability, feedback inhibition, and network
oscillations in area CA3, and makes novel and directly testable predictions
that can guide future experiments.
