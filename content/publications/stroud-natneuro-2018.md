Motor cortex (M1) exhibits a rich repertoire of neuronal activities to support
the generation of complex movements. Although recent neuronal-network models
capture many qualitative aspects of M1 dynamics, they can generate only a few
distinct movements. Additionally, it is unclear how M1 efficiently controls
movements over a wide range of shapes and speeds. We demonstrate that simple
modulation of neuronal input-output gains in recurrent neuronal-network models
with fixed architecture can dramatically reorganize neuronal activity and thus
downstream muscle outputs. Consistent with the observation of diffuse
neuromodulatory projections to M1, we show that a relatively small number of
modulatory control units provide sufficient flexibility to adjust
high-dimensional network activity using a simple reward-based learning rule.
Furthermore, it is possible to assemble novel movements from previously learned
primitives, and one can separately change movement speed while preserving
movement shape. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of modulatory
systems in controlling recurrent cortical activity.
