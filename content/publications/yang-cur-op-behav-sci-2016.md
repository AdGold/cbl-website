<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

A key component of interacting with the world is how to direct ones’ sensors so
as to extract task-relevant information — a process referred to as active
sensing. In this review, we present a framework for active sensing that forms a
closed loop between an ideal observer, that extracts task-relevant information
from a sequence of observations, and an ideal planner which specifies the
actions that lead to the most informative observations. We discuss active
sensing as an approximation to exploration in the wider framework of
reinforcement learning, and conversely, discuss several sensory, perceptual,
and motor processes as approximations to active sensing. Based on this
framework, we introduce a taxonomy of sensing strategies, identify hallmarks of
active sensing, and discuss recent advances in formalizing and quantifying
active sensing.
