Populations of neurons in motor cortex engage in complex transient dynamics of
large amplitude during the execution of limb movements. Traditional network
models with stochastically assigned synapses cannot reproduce this behavior.
Here we introduce a class of cortical architectures with strong and random
excitatory recurrence that is stabilized by intricate, fine-tuned inhibition,
optimized from a control theory perspective. Such networks transiently amplify
specific activity states and can be used to reliably execute multidimensional
movement patterns. Similar to the experimental observations, these transients
must be preceded by a steady-state initialization phase from which the network
relaxes back into the background state by way of complex internal dynamics. In
our networks, excitation and inhibition are as tightly balanced as recently
reported in experiments across several brain areas, suggesting inhibitory
control of complex excitatory recurrence as a generic organizational principle
in cortex.
