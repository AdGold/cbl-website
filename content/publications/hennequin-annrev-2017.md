Inhibitory neurons, although relatively few in number, exert powerful control
over brain circuits. They stabilize network activity in the face of strong
feedback excitation and actively engage in computations. Recent studies reveal
the importance of a precise balance of excitation and inhibition in neural
circuits, which often requires exquisite fine-tuning of inhibitory connections.
We review inhibitory synaptic plasticity and its roles in shaping both
feedforward and feedback control. We discuss the necessity of complex,
codependent plasticity mechanisms to build nontrivial, functioning networks,
and we end by summarizing experimental evidence of such interactions.
