We study the effect of spin-orbit scattering on the statistics of the conductance of a quantum dot for Coulomb blockade peaks and valleys. We find the distribution function of the peak heights for strong spin-orbit scattering in the presence and absence of time reversal symmetry. We find that the application of a magnetic field suppresses the average peak height, similar to the antilocalizaion in the bulk systems. For the valleys, we consider the elastic cotunneling contribution to the conductance and calculate its moments at the crossover between ensembles of various symmetries.
