<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Humans develop rich mental representations that guide their behavior in a
variety of everyday tasks. However, it is unknown whether these
representations, often formalized as priors in Bayesian inference, are specific
for each task or subserve multiple tasks. Current approaches cannot distinguish
between these two possibilities because they cannot extract comparable
representations across different tasks. Here, we develop a novel method, termed
cognitive tomography, that can extract complex, multidimensional priors across
tasks. We apply this method to human judgments in two qualitatively different
tasks, “familiarity” and “odd one out,” involving an ecologically relevant set
of stimuli, human faces. We show that priors over faces are structurally
complex and vary dramatically across subjects, but are invariant across the
tasks within each subject. The priors we extract from each task allow us to
predict with high precision the behavior of subjects for novel stimuli both in
the same task as well as in the other task.  Our results provide the first
evidence for a single high-dimensional structured representation of a
naturalistic stimulus set that guides behavior in multiple tasks. Moreover, the
representations estimated by cognitive tomography can provide independent,
behavior-based regressors for elucidating the neural correlates of complex
naturalistic priors.
