<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Neural responses in the visual cortex are variable, and there is now an
abundance of data characterizing how the magnitude and structure of this
variability depends on the stimulus. Current theories of cortical computation
fail to account for these data; they either ignore variability altogether or
only model its unstructured Poisson-like aspects. We develop a theory in which
the cortex performs probabilistic inference such that population activity
patterns represent statistical samples from the inferred probability
distribution. Our main prediction is that perceptual uncertainty is directly
encoded by the variability, rather than the average, of cortical responses.
Through direct comparisons to previously published data as well as original
data analyses, we show that a sampling-based probabilistic representation
accounts for the structure of noise, signal, and spontaneous response
variability and correlations in the primary visual cortex. These results
suggest a novel role for neural variability in cortical dynamics and
computations.
