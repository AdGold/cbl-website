More and more neural and behavioural data is being collected in increasingly
complex settings, offering unique opportunities to study how brains control
behaviours. A major challenge is to infer the computational and mechanistic
principles underlying adaptive control from this ocean of data. Our lab 
tackles this puzzle in two ways:
- by building network-level theories of brain computation, with an
  emphasis on motor control
- by developing machine learning methodology for analysing complex datasets in
  light of these theories

At both levels, our work builds heavily upon engineering-related domains such as
dynamical systems and control theory, probabilistic machine learning, and
optimization.
