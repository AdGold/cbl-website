Siddharth is a PhD candidate supervised by [Prof Richard E Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/) and advised by [Prof Carl Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/). He joined the group in 2017, after receiving an MEng from University of Cambridge. His PhD is funded by the EPSRC, as well as a [Microsoft Research EMEA PhD Award](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/phd-research-forefront-technology-recognised-award).

He is interested in designing algorithms for large-scale machine learning systems that *learn sequentially* without revisiting past data, are *private* over user data, and are *uncertainty-aware*. He uses probabilistic methods, and has focussed on approximate Bayesian inference techniques, usually variational inference. His research scales these techniques to large Bayesian neural network models, and applies these to the continual learning (/lifelong learning) and federated learning problems.
