Yashar is a University Lecturer in Computational Neuroscience at the [Department of Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). After obtaining his Ph.D. in theoretical condensed matter physics, he has been doing research in computational and theoretical neuroscience, starting with postdocs in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, working with Liam Paninksi and Ken Miller. Afterwards, he started his own group at the [University of Oregon](https://ion.uoregon.edu/content/institute-neuroscience), before moving to CBL at Cambridge.
Yashar's main interest is in understanding the dynamics of neural activity and learning in recurrent neural circuits, at both biological and computational levels. Please get in touch if you are highly motivated to work in this area!
