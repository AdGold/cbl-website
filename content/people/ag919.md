I am a final year PhD student in machine learning advised by [Prof. Carl
Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/) at the University of Cambridge.
My research focuses on improving uncertainty quantification in neural networks (NNs) using Bayesian principles.
To do that, we need to understand our choice of prior affects the properties of trained NNs, and how to do accurate approximate inference.
I'm also interested in AI safety.

I hold a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Oxford. While an
undergraduate at [Universitat Pompeu
Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml/about-us) in Barcelona, I co-founded
[MonkingMe](https://monkingme.com/), an online music distribution company.

I was a co-organiser of the [ICLR 2019
workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/safeml-iclr2019) "Safe Machine Learning:
Specification, Robustness and Assurance".

I used to run the [Engineering Safe AI reading group](https://valuealignment.ml/) about technical approaches to ensuring AI has a positive impact in society, as part of Effective Altruism Cambridge.
