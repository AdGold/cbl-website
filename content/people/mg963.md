Marc holds an MRes in [Environmental Data Science](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge, an MSc in [Hydrology and Water Resources Management](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/prospective-students/postgraduate-taught-admissions/environmental-engineering-cluster/msc-hydrology-and-water-resources-management/) from Imperial College London, and an MEng in [Civil Engineering](https://www.upc.edu/en/masters/civil-engineering) from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (BarcelonaTECH). 

His research interests include probabilistic modelling for environmental and climate sciences. He is currently working on improving precipitation and river flow predictions in data-scarce regions, such as the Himalayas, and exploring how this translates into actionable information for better decision making. 

Marc is a PhD student at the [CBL](https://cbl-website.onrender.com/) and the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/), and works closely with his industrial partner [Mott MacDonald](https://www.mottmac.com/water-and-wastewater). He is a member of Darwin College, and is currently funded by the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in [AI for the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER).
