I joined the group in October 2020 as a fellow of the Cambridge-Tübingen program. I am supervised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://www.is.mpg.de/~bs). I am also advised by [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner). Previously, I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology. My research generally lies in deep representation learning and causality.
