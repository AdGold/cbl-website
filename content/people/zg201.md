## Bio (short) 

Zoubin Ghahramani is  Professor of Information Engineering at the
University of Cambridge and Chief Scientist at Uber.  He is also
Deputy Director of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of
Intelligence, and a Fellow of St John's College. He was a founding
Cambridge Director of the Alan Turing Institute, the UKâ€™s national
institute for data science. He has worked and studied at the
University of Pennsylvania, MIT, the University of Toronto, the Gatsby
Unit at University College London, and Carnegie Mellon University.
His research focuses on probabilistic approaches to machine learning
and artificial intelligence, and he has  published over 250 research
papers on these topics.  He was co-founder of Geometric Intelligence
(now Uber AI Labs) and advises a number of AI and machine learning
companies.  In 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for
his contributions to machine learning.  

##  Bio (medium) 

Zoubin Ghahramani FRS is Professor of Information Engineering at the
University of Cambridge, where he leads the Machine Learning Group
consisting of about 30 researchers, and Chief Scientist at Uber, where
he leads Uber AI Labs. He  served as the
founding Cambridge Director of the Alan
Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for Data Science, 
is Deputy Academic Director of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future
of Intelligence, and a Fellow of St John's College Cambridge.  

He studied computer science and cognitive science at the
University of Pennsylvania, obtained his PhD from MIT in 1995, and was
a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. His academic
career includes concurrent appointments as one of the founding members
of the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit in London, and as a
faculty member of CMU's Machine Learning Department for over 10 years.
His current research interests include statistical machine learning,
Bayesian nonparametrics, scalable inference, probabilistic
programming, and building an automatic statistician.
He has published over 250 papers, receiving
over 38,000 citations (an h-index of 84).  His work has been funded by
grants and donations from EPSRC, DARPA, Microsoft, Google, Infosys,
Facebook, Amazon, FX Concepts, NTT and a number of other industrial
partners.  In 2013, he  received a $750,000 Google Award for research
on building the Automatic Statistician. He has served as advisor to
Microsoft Research Cambridge, VocalIQ (acquired by Apple), Cambridge
Capital Management, Echobox, Informetis, Opera Solutions, and several other companies. 
He has also served in a
number of leadership roles as programme and general chair of the
leading international conferences in machine learning: AISTATS (2005),
ICML (2007, 2011), and NIPS (2013, 2014). In 2015 he was elected a 
Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 2016 he was named as one of the
Top Ten Most Influential Scholars in Machine Learning. More information can be

##  Bio (longer) 

My early childhood was spent in the former Soviet Union and Iran.  My family
then moved to Spain where I attended the [American School of Madrid ](http://www.amerschmad.org/) for
10 years. I studied at the [University of
Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/) where I was given the Dean's Scholar Award and
obtained a BA degree in Cognitive Science and a BSEng degree in
Computer Science and Engineering in 1990. In 1995, I obtained my PhD
in [Cognitive Neuroscience](http://web.mit.edu/bcs/) from
the [Massachusetts Institute of
Technology](http://web.mit.edu/) funded by a Fellowship from the McDonnell-Pew
Foundation. My dissertation was entitled "Computation and Psychophysics
of Sensorimotor Integration" and my PhD advisor was [Michael Jordan](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan).  I moved
to the [University of
Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/uoft.html) in 1995 where I was an ITRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the
Artificial Intelligence Lab of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/),
working with [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton). From 1998 to 2005, I was faculty at
the [Gatsby Computational
Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), [University
College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I am currently Professor of Information Engineering, at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I lead
the activities in the [Machine
Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/). I am also Chief Scientist at Uber, where I
co-founded and help lead Uber AI Labs. From 2002 to 2012 I was concurrently also an
Associate Research Professor in the [Machine Learning Department](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at the
School of 
Computer Science, [Carnegie Mellon
University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I have also been Adjuct Faculty at the Gatsby Unit, University
College London and at POSTECH, South Korea. 

My current research interests include [Bayesian
approaches to machine learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html), artificial intelligence,
statistics, and data science. Statistics provides the mathematical foundations for
handling uncertainty, making decisions, and designing learning
systems.  I have recently worked on Gaussian processes, non-parametric
Bayesian methods, clustering, approximate inference algorithms,
graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, semi-supervised
learning, [probabilistic
programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home), and building an [Automatic Statistician](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/google-award-automatic-statistician).
