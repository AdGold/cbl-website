I am a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellow in computational neuroscience based at the University of Cambridge. I use computer modelling and mathematics to try and understand how the brain processes information and makes complex decisions. I did my PhD at the University of Oxford in computational neuroscience under the supervision of Tim Vogels, Mason Porter, and Guillaume Hennequin. For my PhD, I studied recurrent neuronal-network models of cortical motor circuits. Before my PhD, I worked as a research statistician at the UK Ministry of Defence. I have a BSc in mathematics from the University of East Anglia and an MSc in applied mathematics from Imperial College London.
