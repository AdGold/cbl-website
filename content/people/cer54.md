I'm a professor in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) and head 
of the [Computational and
Biological Learning Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/) in the Division of Information Engineering
at the Department of Engineering in Cambridge.

## Research

I'm interested in the theory and practice of understanding and
building systems that learn and make decisions. Humans have an
exceptional ability to learn from experience, which sets them apart
from current artificial intelligent (AI) systems. To understand human
learning and design better AI we need principled approaches to
learning and decision making based on Bayesian inference in machine
learning. My interests span: probabilistic inference, reinforcement
learning, approximate inference (variational and MCMC), decision
making, non-parametric modeling, stochastic processes and efficient
learning.

## Gaussian Processes

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a principled, practical, probabilistic
approach to learning in flexible non-parametric models. GPs have found
numerous applications in regression, classification, unsupervised
learning and reinforcement learning. Great advances have been made
recently in sparse approximations and approximate inference. 
My book [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml), MIT Press 2006,
with [Chris Williams](http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/homes/ckiw)
is freely available [online](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters). I also maintain the [gpml matlab/octave toolbox](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code) with [Hannes Nickisch](http://hannes.nickisch.org/), as well as the pretty outdated [Gaussian Process](http://gaussianprocess.org/) website.
