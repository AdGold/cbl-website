Will's research interests include scalable approximate inference for Gaussian processes (GPs) in spatio-temporal settings, their application in climate science, and the design of [probabilistic programming frameworks](https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl) which are tailored towards them.

He holds an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](http://www.mlsalt.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge and an MEng in [Engineering Mathematics](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/) from the University of Bristol, and was formerly a researcher at Invenia Labs in Cambridge.
