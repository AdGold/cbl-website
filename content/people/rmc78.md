Since joining the group as a PhD student in 2018, my research has explored
the automation and democratisation of machine learning, including aspects of
hyperparameter optimisation and architecture search, with additional interests
in the ethics and societal implications of our field. I'm supervised by [Dr José
Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/) under funding from EPSRC.
Previously, I received the BA and MEng degrees in Engineering from the
University of Cambridge, specialising in Information and Computer Engineering,
with a year's study of topics in Software Engineering and Aeronautics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
