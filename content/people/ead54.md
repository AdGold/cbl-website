Erik is a PhD candidate supervised by [Dr José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org).
As a [Cambridge-Tübingen fellow](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=1458), he is spending a year of his PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de) in Tübingen, Germany, supervised by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs).
He is also collaborating with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io) at the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io) of the [RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project](https://aip.riken.jp) in Tokyo, Japan.
His research interests broadly revolve around machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a current focus on methods at the intersection of probabilistic modeling and deep learning.

Before embarking on his PhD, he obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), where he also did research on discrete and mixed-variable Bayesian optimization with [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea).
Prior to that, he was based in his hometown of Munich, Germany, where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universität](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and did a research internship at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home.html), working on statistical relational learning with [Volker Tresp](http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/).
He also spent a year at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/), where he did research on batch Bayesian optimization with [Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html).
