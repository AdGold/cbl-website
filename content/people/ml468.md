Máté Lengyel is Professor of Computational Neuroscience at the [Department of Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). Previously, he studied biology for his MSc and neurobiology for his PhD at Eötvös University, Budapest, while working in the [computational neuroscience lab](http://cneuro.rmki.kfki.hu/) of Péter Érdi. He was then a postdoc with Peter Dayan at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), UCL, followed by a visiting research fellowship at the [Collegium Budapest Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.colbud.hu/). He studies learning and memory from computational, algorithmic/representational and neurobiological viewpoints. He also maintains an active interest in the possible computational functions of neural oscillations, particularly those present in the hippocampus and neocortex.
