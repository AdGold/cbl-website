Across a range of motor and cognitive tasks, cortical activity can be
accurately described by low-dimensional dynamics unfolding from specific
initial conditions on every trial. These "preparatory states" largely determine
the subsequent evolution of both neural activity and behaviour, and their
importance raises questions regarding how they are − or ought to be − set.
Here, we formulate motor preparation as **optimal prospective control of future
movements**. The solution is a form of internal control of cortical circuit
dynamics, which can be implemented as a **thalamo-cortical loop** gated by the
basal ganglia. Critically, optimal control predicts **selective quenching of
variability** in components of preparatory population activity that have future
motor consequences, but not in others. This is consistent with recent
perturbation experiments performed in mice, and with our novel analysis of
monkey motor cortex activity during reaching. Together, these results suggest
optimal anticipatory control of movement.
